As part of Ayulla’s Software Engineering Tryout Task (ASETT), You are
tasked with creating an API Hospital Management System using Django
Framework. The project needs to implement the following features:

- Doctors can signup on the system while Patients can’t.
- Doctors can create any patients logins and the patient can use that to
access the system and book appointments.
- Patients can book appointments to see any doctor but only the doctor
who he booked the appointment with, can view the information of the
patient.
- A patient can’t View another patient’s Informations.
- If a doctor has been booked for an appointment at a particular time, the
doctor should not be available for further booking at the said time
